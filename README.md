Gallery

This project is a command-line based photo gallery management system implemented in C++ with MySQL as the database backend. It provides a terminal-driven interface for managing users, albums, pictures, and associated tags.

Album management includes creating, opening, closing, deleting albums, and listing all albums or those created by a specific user. When an album is open, the system allows adding and removing pictures, displaying picture details, listing pictures, tagging or untagging users, and viewing all tags.

User operations include adding new users, removing existing ones, listing all users, and retrieving individual user statistics.

The project also supports query-based operations such as identifying the most tagged user, the most tagged picture, and retrieving all pictures in which a user is tagged.

Utility commands are included for displaying help and exiting the application.

This project is written in C++ and interacts with a MySQL database through a command-line interface, providing a lightweight and efficient way to explore and manage a gallery system.
